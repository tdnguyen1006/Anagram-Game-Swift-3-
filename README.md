# Anagram-Game-Swift-3-

Anagram is a word puzzle game project. The game generates a word, and the player is required
to use the same letters of the word to form an anagram of a legitimate word.
Ex. The game generates “Drawer” and the user can enter “Redraw” as a correct answer.
Scoring is based on how many words you can correctly answered.
The app will have three screens that will allow users to easily navigate pages through the use of
buttons. The main page includes the title of the game, a button to begin the game, and a button
that leads to about section that provides more information on the game. The about page
describes the game, how everything works, and lists the developers of the game. The game
page contains the actual game screen, and navigation buttons for the user to interact with the
game, as well as a text field and keyboard pop up for user input. There will be a question mark
icon for users to interact with that shows a pop up for game rules and how to play.
